Homework #11 Treasure Hunt

Due: Tuesday, November 7th, 11:59 pm

Design a computer game in which a player finds a treasure.
- Using Turtle graphics, create a "treasure square" with a corner at a random (x, y) location on the screen.
- Set the player's starting position at another random (x, y) location on the screen.
- Let the player specify whether they want to move forward, backward,
  turn left or right, and by what distance or angle, in their quest to find the treasure.
- Let the player continue moving until the treasure is found (the player's turtle intersects the boundary of the treasure).
- When the treasure is found, generate a celebration image indicating success.
