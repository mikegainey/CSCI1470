Like a butterfly, or a like bee
Like an ant, as busy as can be
These little words we call the "busy P's"
Prepositions

Nine or ten of them
Do most all of the work
Of, on, to, with, in, from
By, for, at, over, across
And many others do their jobs
Which is simply to connect
Their noun or pronoun object
To some other word in the sentence

Busy P's
If you please
"On the top is where you are!"
Top relates to where you are
"With a friend you'll travel far!"
With a friend you'll go
"If you try you know that you can fly
Over the rainbow!"
Over the rainbow is where you can fly

Busy prepositions
Always on the go
Like a bunch of busy bees
Floating pollen on the breeze
Buzzing over the meadows
Beyond the forest
Through the trees
In to the beehive
Busy, busy P's
In, to, beyond, over, on, through!

Busy prepositions always out in front
On the edges, in the crack
Around the corner, from the back
In between the action
Stating clearly to your satisfaction
The location and direction
Prepositions give specific information

Though little words they are
They never stand alone
Gathering words behind them
You soon will see how they have grown
Into a parade; a prepositional phrase
With a noun, or at least a pronoun, bringing up the rear
A little phrase of two or three or four or more words

Prepositions! Attention! Forward, march!
Busy prepositions
Always on the march
Like a horde of solider ants
Inching bravely forward on the slimmest chance
That they might better their positions
Busy, busy prepositions
In the air, on the ground, everywhere

The sun sank lower in the west
"In the west it sank"
And it will rise in the morning
And will bring the light of day
We say the sun comes up in the east every day!
"In the east it rises"

Busy prepositions
Busy, busy, busy!
On the top is where you are!
On the top
If you try you know that you can fly!
Fly where?
Over the rainbow
