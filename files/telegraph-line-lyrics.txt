There's a telegram for you ma'am,
And the message is clear.
It says there's something bugging you
And buzzing in your ear.
The results can be quite itchy
So what is your reply?
Tell your arm to swat that fly!

Hey, there's a telegraph line,
You got yours and I got mine.
It's called the nervous system,
And everybody understands
Those telegram commands
And you know that everybody better listen!

The central nervous system
Is the brain and the spine.
The brain controls the system
And the spine is the line.
Telegrams come in
To tell what's happening to you,
Then telegrams go out
To tell your body what to do.

There's a telegram for you sir,
Better read it on the spot.
It says your hand is near a stove
That's very, very hot.
The results can be quite painful,
And there's no time to think,
Quick! Pull that hand away, and get it to the sink!

There's a telegraph line,
You got yours and I got mine.
It's called the nervous system,
And everybody understands
Those telegram commands
And you know that everybody better listen!

Your peripheral nerves,
They go all out,
Delivering those messages
Your senses send out.
From your hearing and touch
To your sight and taste and smell,
They let your brain react
To all the messages they tell.

There's a telegram for you, kid,
And it's at an awful time.
It says you've got to go on stage
And you forgot your lines
You're gonna be embarassed,
'Cause this telegram's a rush.
Your heart starts beatin' faster and you blush!

Hey, there's a telegraph line,
You got yours and I got mine.
It's called the nervous system,
And everybody understands
Those telegram commands
And you know that everybody better listen!

The autonomic system
Has a hold of you,
Controlling automatically,
Some things that you do.
Your breathing and your heartbeat
Just go on naturally
And when you're scared, you're nerves
Rev up the speed!
