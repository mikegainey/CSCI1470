Homework #7 Alphabetic Telephone Number Translator

Due: Thursday October 19, 2017. 11:59PM

On a standard telephone, alphabetic letters are mapped to numbers in the following fashion:

A, B, and C = 2
D, E, and F = 3
G, H, and I = 4
J, K, and L = 5
M, N, and O = 6
P, Q, and R = 7  *** this should include the letter 's' ***
T, U, and V = 8
W, X, Y, and Z = 9

Write a fruitful function that takes any string of alphanumeric characters and returns a string with all alphabetic
characters in the argument translated into their numeric equivalent, using the above mapping. (6 points)

Many companies use telephone numbers like 713-GET-FOOD to make it easier for their customers to remember.
But for customers, it is easier to dial a pure numeric phone number, rather than an alphanumeric number.

Write an application program that asks the user to enter a 10 character alphanumeric telephone number
  in the form of XXX-XXX-XXXX.

The application should then call your function to translate the alphanumeric phone number into its equivalent
numeric phone number and display the result.

For example if the user enters 713-GET-FOOD the application should display 713-438-3663.

The application should allow the user to continue translating phone numbers until she/he decides to stop.

Use meaningful variable names. (6 points)
