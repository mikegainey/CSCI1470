# Assignment: Homework #5
#
# Algorithm:
#
#   Import the random module in order to generate random numbers later.
#   Seed the random number generator.
#   Set LOWERBOUND to 1 and UPPERBOUND to 20, the bounds of the numbers used in the questions.
#   Set again to 'y' so the loop will run the first time
#   Loop while again is 'y':
#       Initialize (to zero) variables to track the number of questions asked & number of correct responses.
#       Display the main welcome message.
#
#       Display an "Addition" heading.
#       Begin a loop to cover the 2 addition questions:
#           Generate 2 random numbers (LOWERBOUND to UPPERBOUND), num1 & num2.
#           Display an addition question, (num1 + num2 = ), and get a response.
#           Increment the question counter.
#           Set answer to the correct answer (num1 + num2).
#           If the response is correct, tell the student and increment the correct response counter.
#
#       Display a "Subtraction" heading.
#       Begin a loop to cover the 2 subtraction questions:
#           Generate 2 random numbers (LOWERBOUND to UPPERBOUND), num1 & num2.
#           Display a subtraction question, (num1 - num2 = ), and get a response.
#           Increment the question counter.
#           Set answer to the correct answer (num1 - num2).
#           If the response is correct, tell the student and increment the correct response counter.
#
#       Display a "Multiplication" heading.
#       Begin a loop to cover the 2 multiplication questions:
#           Generate 2 random numbers (LOWERBOUND to UPPERBOUND), num1 & num2.
#           Display a multiplication question, (num1 * num2 = ), and get a response.
#           Increment the question counter.
#           Set answer to the correct answer (num1 * num2).
#           If the response is correct, tell the student and increment the correct response counter.
#
#       Display a "Division" heading (with a note to only give the whole number answer).
#       Begin a loop to cover the 2 division questions:
#           Generate 2 random numbers (LOWERBOUND to UPPERBOUND), num1 & num2.
#           Display a division question, (num1 รท num2 = ), and get a response.
#           Increment the question counter.
#           Set answer to the correct answer (num1 // num2).
#           If the response is correct, tell the student and increment the correct response counter.
#
#       Display a "Modulus" heading.
#       Begin a loop to cover the 2 modulus questions:
#           Generate 2 random numbers (LOWERBOUND to UPPERBOUND), num1 & num2.
#           Display a modulus question, (num1 % num2 = ), and get a response.
#           Increment the question counter.
#           Set answer to the correct answer (num1 % num2).
#           If the response is correct, tell the student and increment the correct response counter.
#
#   Set score to the percentage of questions answered correctly.
#   Round score to a whole number to make the output look lice.
#
#   Display the score.
#
#   Prompt the user to take the quiz again.
#   Set again to 'no' if the user just presses <Enter>.
#   Set again to just the first character of the response and convert to lowercase.
#   (If again is 'y' the loop will run again, otherwise the program will end.)
