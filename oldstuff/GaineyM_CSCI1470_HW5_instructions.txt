Homework #05

Due: Thursday, October 5th at 11:59 pm

Design and write a Python program that gives and grades a math quiz.
The quiz will give 2 problems for each of the arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /, and %.
- First, two addition problems will be presented (one at a time) with random numbers between 1 and 20.
- Then two subtraction problems,
- multiplication,
- division (use // and do floor division; for example: for 10//3, the answer should be 3)
- modulus.

For an example of the first problem:
- the program generates two random numbers (let's say num1 is 17 and num2 is 5),
- and prints out a statement of the problem as 17 + 5 =.
- The user will enter a correct answer or a wrong answer.
- If the answer is correct, a message will be printed and one will be added to the number of correct answers.
- Then the second addition problem is given and checked.
- Next, two subtraction problems will be given and checked, and so on.
- At the end of 10 problems, a final score is printed out.
- The user is asked if they want to take another quiz.
