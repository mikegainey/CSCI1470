Homework #8 Decoder and String date converter

Due: Thursday, October 26th 11:59pm

Design and write a Python program that decodes a secret message.  A string contains several words.
Use the split( ) function to convert the string into a list of words.
The first letter of each word is written to a new string, spelling out the secret message.
For example, "governors only ask strangers to run over skunks", would generate the secret message 'goastros'.
Your program should accept strings from users and generate the secret message. (5 points)

- Use a list to determine the month names. (5 points)
